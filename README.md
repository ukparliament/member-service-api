## Requirements
Member Service API requires the following
* [Ruby 2.3.1][ruby]


## Getting Started
Setup the main application repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ukparliament/member-service-api.git
cd member-service-api
bundle install
cp .env.sample .env
```

Within the `.env` file, you will need to specify the `UKPDS_DATA_ENDPOINT` value. Without this, the application will not run successfully. The

### Running the application
We recommend running the application through docker. With docker installed on your machine, run:
```bash
make build
make dev
```

`make build` creates a docker image on your machine

`make dev` runs the application and attaches the current directory into the docker container. This means updates you make to the views and contollers will be automatically reflected.
